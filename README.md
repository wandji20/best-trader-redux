# Catalogue of Dog Clothes

# Best Trader

A React Redux app which fetches data from API endpoint and displays this data on the main page based on a filter if any.
Also, it uses React Redux Routes to navigate about the app. To achieve these, I used

- functional components
- components lifecycle methods
- state and props
- testing
- store
- thunks
- hooks
- prop types
- actions
- reducers
